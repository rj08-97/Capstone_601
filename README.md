The goals of this study are to 1) explore relationships between differentially expressed mRNAs and their encoded proteins to determine whether there is a linear relationship between mRNA expression levels and the levels of their encoded proteins, 2) identify relationships among genes carrying mutations and the pathways in which they play a role to determine the effect those mutations have on complex biological pathways and 3) identify relationships among the expression levels of genes that encode transcription factors and the genes they regulate. The important questions that will be addressed in this study are, 1) does every transcribed mRNA leads to the translation of protein, 2) how do the identified mutations in transcription factors, gene products that regulate transcription, affect the process of transcription and translation. Moreover, the study will also focus on the relationship between the transcription factors and the mutations in these factors will be studied. For example, if there is a rise in the mutation, does that affect the transcription process. 


Biology is complicated, so much that happens within the human body that we do not  understand. There was a time when biology was considered simple science, and it was not until the discovery of DNA structure that made scientists realize just how much we do not know. Gene expression and regulation describes the complexity of a human body, transcription is an important stage in gene expression. Therefore, having a good understanding of the relationship between transcription and translation is very important as they play a very significant role in every cell within the human body.  Disruption of either process can lead to disease.
